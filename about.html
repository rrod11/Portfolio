            <!-- Born in the 90s, fashionably late, March of '99, I am one of a kind.
            Adventurous and Introverted at the exact same time. Loud and Quiet
            in the same thought. Brazen if I believe the issue at hand needs to
            be fought. I am an independent thinker that loves to collaborate and
            mesh ideas together. I am an art, music, sports, animal, and all
            things life lover!
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I personally assure you that you will fall in
            <em>love</em>

            is my personality the moment you engage in any conversation worth
            discussing. From the moment you engage me to the moment you try to
            walk away our banter will be your persistent thought. Take some time
            to understand the simple intricacy that is me with a humble display
            of my talents as your peruse what makes me me, the projects I am
            proud of, and the things that interest me -->
            A unique blend of passion and purpose defines my journey as a software engineer. With a birthdate in the late 90s, I embrace the spirit of innovation and independent thinking. I am driven by a dual natureâ€”adventurous yet introspective, vocal yet contemplative. I thrive on the fusion of ideas and relish the collaborative process.
          </p>
            <p>

Beyond the world of coding, I am an ardent enthusiast of art, music, sports, and life's myriad experiences. This diverse tapestry of interests enriches my perspective and fuels my creativity, infusing vitality into every project I undertake.
My commitment to nonconformity extends beyond personal expression; it influences my approach to problem-solving.

                  <p>
                    I love building and taking things apart. I thrive on the

                  <p>
                    I have on my bachelor of science degree in Biology from the

                    My passion for software engineering stems from a love for both creation and deconstruction. I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of understanding the "why" behind every line of code, every framework, and every architecture. However, more than the technical aspects, I've learned the art of problem-solving, the importance of collaboration, and the satisfaction of delivering elegant solutions to complex challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
Each project undertaken has been a classroom, teaching me not just technical skills but also the nuances of teamwork, adaptability, and the iterative nature of improvement. My quest for knowledge and mastery remains unwavering, driving me to continually explore, learn, and grow in this ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.
In my journey thus far, I've acquired proficiency in a diverse array of languages, libraries, and frameworks. Notable among these are:
